# crds_signin_checkin
Crossroads Sign-in and Check-in system for Ministry Platform

## Components
There are two components in this repository - the Angular 2.0 [front end](front_end), and the .Net back end [REST API](SignInCheckIn).

As a developer working on the front end, you will need to follow the front end [setup instructions](front_end/README.md).  This includes acquiring an API key to use for all REST requests.
